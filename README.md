Conclusions:
  
  1) The data shows that small to medium sized schools has a significantly higher percentage of both passing math scores and passing reading scores when compared to large schools.
      - This can explan the reasoning why the data also shows why charter schools (which are typically medium to small in size ) having a greater success-rate than district schools.
      - the top and bottom performing schools reflect this trend as well. The top 5 performing schools are all charter schools, while the bottom 5 performing schools are all district schools.
  
  2) Another conclusion that can be made is that the relative percentage of passing grades in both math and reading across 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades are consistent relative to the school. It does not change significantly across the grades.
